bio: Sarah Jiwoo Chung is a Korean-Canadian creative based in Toronto. Much of her work stems from hosting social events where conversations eventually lead to meticulously executed projects. As an art director and copywriter, she brings to light the hidden corners and unspoken habits of everyday life. Her most recent project, fond, encompasses the importance of curating family-like bonds for young people over a shared meal.

fond encourages young folks to share more dinners together.

This idea is driven by the need for IRL connections. fond is a curator, inspiration, a set of intentions for the purpose of repeated application and evolution. fond = the revival of the third space. It embodies the post-digital, the word of mouth, the hard copy.

The two components are: (1) the website which acts as our central housing unit embracing the beliefs of web 1.0, i.e. read-only information repositories, acting not as a means of connection but a way of disseminating what fond stands for; (2) the in-person actions and community work that is carried out by our audience.
