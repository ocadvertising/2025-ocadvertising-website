bio: Adelle Kingma is a Toronto-based artist and designer that grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. She is and continues to be  inspired by the shapes and patterns that exist in nature, and loves to incorporate that into her work.  Her work ranges from graphic design and copy to mixed-media pieces, and she is always looking to discover new and exciting mediums and techniques. When she's not in the studio, you'll find her outside in the sun with a good book.
