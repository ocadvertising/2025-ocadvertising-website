bio: I am a 22-year-old based in Mississauga, Canada, and I have always loved creating short films, making absurd designs, and experimenting with vast mixed media. Entering the advertising industry, I doubted that the work would align with what I enjoy creating. But as I graduate here in June, I continue to be inspired by the crazy talented advertising creatives I learn from around me, working towards my own iterative projects that aim to be as strategically sound and artistically original.
