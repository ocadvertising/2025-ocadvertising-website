The obstacles in our way aren't the end, they're an opportunity to find a new path forwardâ€¦

> Without a doubt, Toronto is more congested than ever; a challenge we all face. Traffic affects everything from deliveries to daily commutes, and it comes with a serious impact on our environment. Transportation accounts for about one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions in Toronto.
> As a leader in the transportation sector, FedEx is reimagining how we navigate our urban last-mile deliveries.
> With electric cargo bikes, we are taking a smarter, more sustainable path forward. Our agile, zero-emission bikes efficiently navigate Toronto's bike lanes and parkways. Each delivery is led by a professional rider who is always on time, courteous and full of energy.
> Through E-Deliveries, FedEx is keeping sustainability in motion and your business on the green path.
