bio: "Hi, I’m Julia Monteleone — a marketing and social media professional with a background in visual communication from OCAD University. I’m passionate about creating content that feels intentional, on-brand, and engaging across every platform.

Currently, I manage digital strategy and content creation for a busy team, where I get to blend creativity with analytics and keep things fresh, consistent, and meaningful.

My long-term goal is to grow into a creative director role — leading bold campaigns, inspiring teams, and shaping the kind of work that makes an impact."
