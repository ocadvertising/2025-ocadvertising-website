Remora is a digital platform designed to document and celebrate the creative process, supporting artists as they reflect, refine, and collaborate.Artists start by creating a project—a song, a painting, a poem, a dance, etc.—and move through four flexible stages: Inspiration, Formation, Creation, and Expression.

In each phase, they can upload videos, sketches, sounds, and notes to track how their work evolves. Projects can be private, shared publicly, and opened to collaborators. When artists collaborate, both can add edits and updates, with the project reflected across each of their profiles—building the journey together.

The platform brings together two communities: artists and audiences. Artists submit evidence of their practice to be verified and receive a blue star, allowing them to create and collaborate on projects. Audiences can view open projects, leave comments, and—as planned in the future—support each stage financially, not just the final result.Everyone becomes part of the story from the beginning, building deeper connections and strengthening cultural memory through shared experience.

As someone who came to design through storytelling, music, dance, and journalism, I wanted to create something that honors all the ways artists move through the world—not just what they make, but how they make it.
I imagined a space where artists could make a home for their process, collaborate across disciplines, connect more meaningfully with their audience, and leave a mark for the future.The raw beginnings, the doubts, the discoveries—those in-between moments hold so much meaning. Yet in a world that often rewards only the polished result or the trending outcome, that part of the story is too easily lost.

Remora is here to hold space for that process. Artists can document each phase of
their journey—on their own terms—and choose how to share it: privately, publicly,
or with trusted collaborators. Supporters can engage with works-in-progress, leave
comments, or contribute donations at any stage—recognizing the value of the journey,
not just the final product.

This isn’t about perfection. It’s about presence. When artists share their creative paths—including the pauses, pivots, and unresolved moments—they create space for others to relate, reflect, and innovate. Process isn’t something to hide—it’s a cultural gift, a spark for something new.This project is deeply rooted in my own practice of exploring cultural memory and the emotional logic of creation. I believe that when we share how we make—not just what—we build deeper connections, preserve the stories that matter, and imagine new ways forward.
