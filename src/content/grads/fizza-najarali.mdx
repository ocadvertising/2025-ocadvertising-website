Smooth It Over is a campaign that repositions Vaseline as more than just a skincare staple: it becomes the solution to all things dry. From flaky apologies, crusty relationships, and dry behaviour, this campaign flips Vaseline into Gen Z’s ultimate Life Hack Hero.

I developed the concept from start to finish. From writing, recording, and editing all campaign copy (including 3 original diss tracks), to designing posters, producing a full case study video, and building a multi-platform strategy, my campaign brings Vaseline into the heart of Gen Z culture!

Using humor, spoken word, diss culture, and social trends, the campaign invites people to call out what’s “too dry to keep letting slide” and to smooth it over with Vaseline.But this goes beyond a clever ad.

This is a brand renaissance.Gen Z doesn’t just consume content: they co-create it.And Smooth It Over gives them the space to speak out, roast the nonsense, and shift the narrative. It redefines what “dry” means for an entire generation, making Vaseline the go-to solution not just for skin, but for every kind of friction we face today.

This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Vaseline to evolve from a quiet household name into a bold, culturally relevant force, leading a movement to cancel dryness, flakiness, and crustiness by smoooooothing it all over!
