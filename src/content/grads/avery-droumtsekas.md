bio: Avery is a Toronto-based multidisciplinary artist whose practice includes art direction, graphic design, photography, illustration and sculpture. Her art aims to explore the varied experiences of womanhood, chronic pain, and queerness, with much of her work centring on validating marginalised people's experiences of catharsis. You can often find her musing about signage on the streetcar, discussing feminist film theory at Canadian Tire, and postering on Church Street.
