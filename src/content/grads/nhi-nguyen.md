Founded in 2025, Ôrchive is a brand rooted in the exploration of self-identity. The project was initially created for young Vietnamese people who are shaping their paths and sense of self. It began with a question: What are we made of?

With a growing collection of themes, each tag invites you to reflect on moments from your past, things you hold in the present, hopes for the future, or parts of yourself that have always been there. Here, you are always the one who answers. Ôrchive builds a system to make that easier by printing your words onto a tag, along with your name, the theme you chose, and the date it was made.

Ôrchive isn’t here to define who you are. It’s a starting point. It’s a space where exploration is unfiltered and entirely your own. It’s something you can collect, rearrange, or keep close in different ways with Ôrchive’s tag carriers and guide. These tags can be anything: a part of you, a personal archive, or simply a small decoration.

Whatever they become, they exist so you don’t forget who you are.

> With all the ways people try to define identity, we sometimes lose sight of ourselves and the things that truly shaped us.
> Clothes have tags that tell us what they’re made of: Origin. Instruction. Composition.
> Ôrchive believes people need it just as much.A way to say: This is what I’m made of.
